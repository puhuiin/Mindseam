"""mindseam — an instrument for the Mindseam skill.

It knows one thing you cannot know accurately: what state you were in a few seams
ago. It keeps that record and hands it back. It decides nothing, and it blocks
nothing.

Exit codes mean one thing only:

    0   it did what you asked
    2   it could not do what you asked

It never exits non-zero to stop you from working. The one thing it declines to do
is write a malformed entry into the ledger, because a ledger you cannot trust is
worse than no ledger — it looks like state.

    Borrowed from ``git log -n N`` / ``gh run list --limit N`` /
    ``docker logs --tail N`` — a tail / limit interface over an
    append-only record. The history file is the controller's
    audit log; the only thing the model loses between seams is what
    it did not write down, and a tail view lets a host or human
    re-anchor without re-running a seam. ``--reverse`` borrows
    ``git log --reverse`` to surface the oldest row first, which is
    the right order when the reader wants the chronological origin
    of a pattern rather than its most recent appearance.
    ``--since`` borrows ``docker logs --since 30m`` /
    ``journalctl --since "1 hour ago"`` — keep only the rows that
    landed within the last N seconds, so a host can scope the
    audit log to the most recent run.
    ``--grep`` borrows ``git log --grep "TODO"`` /
    ``docker logs | grep ERROR`` — keep only the rows whose next
    action matches a substring, so a host can scope the audit
    log to a specific topic.
    ``--keep N`` borrows ``logrotate --keep N`` /
    ``docker system prune --filter 'until=24h'`` /
    ``journalctl --vacuum-time=2weeks``: discard rows older than
    the last N, and persist the truncated history back to disk
    so the next invocation sees the slimmed window.
    ``--row-id N`` borrows ``git log --skip N -n 1`` /
    ``jq '.['N-1']'`` / ``sed -n 'Np' file``: return the single
    row at the 1-based index ``N``, the way ``kubectl get pod -n
    N`` / ``hm --row N`` do. ``--json`` returns a single-row
    payload; the text path prints the same fields the default
    table prints, with a ``row N of M`` header. ``--row-id``
    must run before every other render flag, including
    ``--json``, because a host that wants just the row payload
    does not need the table or the warning.
    so the next invocation sees the slimmed file. The render
    flag is the destructive part: ``--keep`` is a write, the
    others are reads.

    Borrowed from ponytail's ``/ponytail-audit`` contract: scan the
    whole artefact, not a diff; one line per finding in the form
    ``<tag> <what to cut>. <replacement>.`` ranked biggest first; end
    with the net count. If there is nothing to cut, say so in ponytail's
    own words. Report only — audit writes nothing and exits 0 whether
    or not findings exist; ``--strict`` turns findings into a non-zero
    exit for CI pipelines that want the gate.

    ``--intensity`` borrows ponytail's ladder (``PONYTAIL_DEFAULT_MODE``
    pattern): the flag wins over the ``MINDSEAM_INTENSITY`` environment
    variable, the environment wins over the ``full`` default. ``lite``
    caps the printed report at the three most severe findings and says
    how many were held back; ``full`` prints everything; ``off`` is the
    ponytail-off refusal — audit does not run. The JSON face always
    carries the complete finding list, the way a host that asked for
    JSON asked for the data, not the dial.

    ``--tag`` borrows from ``gh pr list --label <name>`` /
    ``cargo bench --bench <name>``: a comma-separated list of tags
    narrows the report to just those tags. The full finding set is
    still computed, but only the chosen tags are printed and only
    the chosen tags are reflected in the JSON ``findings`` array;
    the ``by_tag`` map in JSON carries the count per tag so a host
    can tell which tags fired. An unknown tag is refused with exit
    2 to stderr, the way ``gh --label unknown`` refuses an
    unrecognised label.

    ``--baseline <path>`` borrows from ``eslint --baseline`` /
    ``terraform plan -detailed-exitcode``: a JSON file of
    already-acknowledged findings. Findings whose (tag, what)
    fingerprint matches a baseline entry are moved into the
    ``baselined_findings`` list (JSON) and marked ``[baselined]``
    in the text face; the ``net`` count, ``by_tag`` map, and
    ``--strict`` gate see only the *fresh* (non-baselined)
    findings. A clean run under a baseline reports
    ``lean: true, net: 0, gate: clean`` while still listing the
    baselined debt in ``baselined_findings``.

    ``--baseline-write <path>`` borrows from
    ``eslint --output-file``'s ``outputFile`` option: write
    the current findings to a JSON file so the next run can
    use it as the baseline. The write happens before the
    report, so a single invocation can record and gate:
    ``audit --baseline-write X --baseline X`` writes the state
    and then marks every current finding as baselined in the
    same run. Because a baseline commits to the whole ledger
    state (r182), it refuses to compose with ``--since`` /
    ``--until`` / ``--at`` (r201, exit 2): the narrowed history
    fingerprints different findings, and a windowed write would
    silently under-gate every later full audit.

    ``--since`` / ``--until`` borrow from ``journalctl --since`` /
    ``find -newer``: a time window in seconds before "now" that
    narrows the history slice the facet tags see. The ledger
    surface tags (``delete`` / ``stdlib`` / ``yagni`` /
    ``core-drift``) keep operating on the full ledger — they
    have nothing to do with time. Negative values are refused
    with exit 2 to stderr.

    ``--at <row_id>`` borrows from ``git log -1`` /
    ``gh pr view N``: a 1-based row index that slices the
    history to ``hist[:N]`` (everything that had happened by
    that seam). Out-of-range values are refused with exit 2 to
    stderr. The text face header names the seam; the JSON face
    carries the slice in an ``at`` block.
