"""Round 164 guards: the write lock.

The controller writes to ``.mindseam/WORKSPACE.md`` and
``.mindseam/history.json`` from a handful of paths: ``note``,
``seam``, ``ship``, ``skillbook``, ``audit --baseline-write``.
Two concurrent writers — a CI pipeline running ``note`` and
``seam`` in parallel, a host's ``from_stdin`` thread, two
agents in the same workspace — can interleave their
read-modify-write cycles and produce a corrupted ledger.

r164 borrows from ``flock(2)`` / ``git index.lock`` /
``cargo build --locked`` / SQLite's ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``: an
advisory file lock under ``.mindseam/write.lock``. The lock
is acquired before the temp-file write and released after
the ``os.replace``, so a second writer that arrives mid-write
sees ``EEXIST`` and the controller refuses with an error
string. Windows / Linux / macOS all support
``os.O_CREAT | os.O_EXCL`` with the same atomicity
guarantee, so the helper is portable.

The lock file's body is the holder's PID, the way ``git
status`` reports ``.git/index.lock`` so a human can grep
the holder. ``info --json`` now always emits a
``lock_state`` block (free / held_by_us / held_by_other);
a host can read this before launching a write to avoid
the race entirely, the way ``flock -n`` reports "another
process holds the lock" without waiting.
