# Mindseam Cognition Suite V3.6

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1308234922.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/1308234922)

Mindseam Cognition Suite is a model-agnostic inference-time control system for deep reasoning,
long-horizon work, tool use, verification, and recovery. It is packaged as a Skill for
cross-platform use, selective loading, and low-friction integration.

The suite organizes an agent's accessible working representations into a deliberately managed
workspace. It operates through a single entry, eleven selectively loaded modules, three supporting
references, and an optional standard-library controller for durable task state.

Mindseam operates at inference time. Model weights and training remain unchanged.

**Acknowledgements** — compute for this project's development and testing was provided by
[VSLLM](https://vsllm.com); thanks to VSLLM for the model tokens that made this work possible.

## Quick start

### Option A — manual installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Locate the user-level Skills directory used by your AI host.
3. Copy the complete [`mindseam/`](mindseam/) directory into it so that the installed entry is
   `<skills-directory>/mindseam/SKILL.md`.
4. Run the integrity check with an available Python 3 interpreter:

   ```text
   <python-command> <skills-directory>/mindseam/scripts/verify_suite.py
   ```

   Replace `<python-command>` with the Python 3 command available on the host, commonly
   `python`, `python3`, or `py -3`.

5. Reload the host if it discovers Skills at startup.

The directory must remain intact because `SKILL.md` routes to relative paths under `modules/`,
`references/`, and `scripts/`.

The repository-level `LICENSE` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` remain part of the distribution.
Include copies of both when redistributing `mindseam/` as a standalone package.

### Option B — ask an AI agent to install it

Copy the following prompt into an agent that can access files and this repository:

```text
Install Mindseam Cognition Suite from
https://github.com/Tiger3807861189/Mindseam-Cognition-Suite-V3.6
into this environment's user-level Skills directory.

First inspect the host configuration or documentation to locate the correct Skills directory.
Install the complete mindseam/ directory as mindseam/, preserving SKILL.md, modules/, references/,
and scripts/. If a mindseam target already exists, compare it and ask before replacing anything.
Run scripts/verify_suite.py with an available Python 3 interpreter after installation.

When finished, report the installed path and verification result, then tell me how this host
invokes the Skill. Briefly explain fast, full, and loop, and explain that the optional controller
records long-task state rather than choosing solutions. If this host has no native Skill loader,
explain the selective system/developer-instruction integration instead of reporting an
installation.
```

### Use it

Invoke the Skill through the mechanism provided by your host—such as its Skill picker,
`/mindseam`, `$mindseam`, or a direct request:

```text
Use mindseam for this task. Audit this repository, preserve its architecture,
verify every finding, and keep the work consistent across all affected files.
```

The entry gate selects the lightest suitable pass automatically.

## Operating modes

| Pass | Suitable work | What loads |
|---|---|---|
| `fast` | One step, or a result checkable in one glance | Nothing extra |
| `full` | Several dependent steps and one bounded deliverable | One or two relevant modules; `ship` before delivery |
| `loop` | Multiple stages, files, turns, tools, or persistent state | Ledger, seams, checkpoints, register audit, and recovery |

A request for brevity changes the outer response length while verification remains aligned with
the task's floor. Short work stays light; long work receives durable state only when it needs it.

## Core mechanisms

| Mechanism | Function |
|---|---|
| Selective workspace loading | Keeps one or two load-bearing ideas active and externalizes the rest |
| Broadcast hub | Gives dependent branches one shared source for names, values, constraints, and style anchors |
| Dense Track | Carries long internal chains in compact, decodable notation before returning to clean outer language |
| Bridge-before-conclusion reasoning | Makes required intermediates explicit before a conclusion consumes them |
| Metacognitive control | Routes confidence, inconsistency, and failure signals into a concrete next action |
| Empirical escape and verification | Converts stalled derivation into bounded tests with a named verifier and coverage |
| First-person agency and functional echo | Uses `I`, `we`, `let's`, and `we need` to bind workspace state to later actions and checks |

The mechanisms are selectively loaded. They are not a fixed checklist for every request.

## Optional controller

[`mindseam/scripts/mindseam.py`](mindseam/scripts/mindseam.py) externalizes `loop` state into
`.mindseam/` in the current task workspace. Invoke it by its resolved Skill path while keeping
the task workspace as the current directory.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `note --goal "..." --next "..."` | Open the ledger and define done plus the first action |
| `note --next "..."` | Replace the single next action after a checkpoint or seam |
| `note --core "..."` | Record a hub entry |
| `note --core "..." --core-slot 1` | Swap a selected live hub entry |
| `note --check "..." --by "..."` | Append a checkpoint with verifier and coverage |
| `note --open "..." --settled-by "..."` | Record a question and what would settle it |
| `note --close N --check "..." --by "..."` | Close question `N` against a new recorded checkpoint |
| `note --error "domain: what broke"` | Record what failed on this step so the error detectors can see it |
| `note --outcome "ok"` | Record how the step actually landed, apart from what was claimed |
| `note --extra-steps N` | Record how many unplanned sub-steps the step cost |
| `note --marker OPEN` | Tag the seam with a role marker (bound action and settle) |
| `note --confidence strong` | Record calibrated confidence for the step |
| `note --verifier "command exit 0"` | Name the verifier behind a check |
| `ship FILE --strict` | Same register check; non-zero exit on completion-gate failures |
| `seam` | Re-read current state and report recent movement |
| `seam --json` | Same seam report, machine-readable JSON |
| `ship FILE` | Inspect outgoing text for register leakage and failure signatures |
| `resume` | Reload the premise, invariants, and full ledger after a long gap |
| `skillbook` | Print recurring patterns extracted from session history |
| `skillbook --json` | Same, machine-readable JSON |
| `info` | Print what the suite has learned about this workspace |
| `info --json` | Same, machine-readable JSON; carries an `audit_summary` block (lean, net, by_tag, top tag) and a `lock_state` block so a host reads the audit roll-up alongside the rest of the workspace health |
| `info --workspace-id` | Emit a 16-hex workspace fingerprint (path + ledger mtime) so a host can verify it is in the right workspace (like `direnv stdlib` / `poetry env info`) |
| `info --audit-baseline <path>` | Carry an `audit_baseline_diff` block (fresh / baselined / drift) using the same baseline file as `audit --baseline` (like `flutter analyze --baseline`) |
| `info --manifest` | Carry an `audit_manifest` block listing every tag the audit can fire, including tags that did not fire (seen-but-clean = 0) so a host can verify the detector set actually ran |
| `info --mtime` | Carry a `workspace_files` block listing each ledger artefact (WORKSPACE.md / history.json / metacognition.json / skillbook.md) with mtime, size, presence (like `find -printf` / `stat`) |
| `info --health` | Carry a `health` block rolling up `lock_state` + `audit_summary.lean` + `warnings` + `long_gap` into a single `ok` / `degraded` / `unhealthy` status with a `reasons` list (like `kubectl get componentstatus` / `systemctl is-system-running`) |
| `info --text` | Force a plain-text report even if `--json` is also set (like the text face of `gh` / `kubectl -o wide`) |
| `info --content-hash` | Emit a `content_hash` block with a short SHA-1 of each ledger artefact, so a host can detect content changes even when mtime is unreliable (like `git rev-parse --short` / `sha1sum`) |
| `info --changed` | Emit a `changed` block listing which ledger artefacts changed since the last info call; the previous hashes are persisted in `.mindseam/info-state.json` and overwritten on every call (like the porcelain output of `git status`) |
| `info --features` | Emit a `features` block listing every flag, block, and gate the controller can do, indexed by stable id and the round that introduced it (like the features list of `gh` / `rustup component list`) |
| `info --format path1,path2` | Render only the values at the given dot-paths (like `docker inspect --format` / `jq -r`). The same flag rides on `seam` / `resume` / `ship` / `skillbook` / `discover` / `audit`, with exit contracts byte-identical to the JSON face. `history` keeps its per-row template `--format`; `note` is an editor and stays single-face |
| `info --field path.key` | Single-token dot-path shorthand for `--format`; mutually exclusive with `--format` (the way `kubectl get -o json -o yaml` refuses two output formats) |
| `info --aliases` | Emit an `aliases` block listing built-in and user-defined short names; user aliases come from `.mindseam/aliases.json`. A bare alias name (`mindseam.py audit-ci`) auto-expands to its full argv before argparse sees it (like `git co` → `git checkout` / the list output of `gh alias`) |
| `info --explain info-memory` | Print the static doc for one capability id (summary, since, default) and exit (like `kubectl explain`); the doc comes from the built-in feature catalog, so it works in an empty workspace and creates no ledger; unknown ids refuse with exit 2 |
| `discover` | List modules / domains selected for the next pass |
| `discover --json` | Same, machine-readable JSON |
| `audit` | Report tagged ledger waste, biggest cut first (report only, borrowed from ponytail) |
| `audit --json` | Same, machine-readable JSON; every finding carries an `evidence` block (row indices, normalised text, counts) so the verdict is traceable |
| `audit --strict` | Exit non-zero when a finding is reported (CI gate) |
| `audit --intensity lite` | Cap the printed findings at 3 (`full` default, `off` refuses; `MINDSEAM_INTENSITY` sets the default) |
| `audit --tag core-drift,next-stall` | Only the listed tags; unknown tags refuse with exit 2 (like `gh pr list --label`). Tag set: `delete`, `stdlib`, `yagni`, `shrink`, `goal-stale`, `next-stall`, `core-drift`. Evidence rides through the projection |
| `audit --since 3600` | Only the last hour of history feeds the facet tags; ledger surface tags keep operating on the full book (like `journalctl --since`) |
| `audit --since 30m` / `--since 7d` / `--since 2026-09-01` | r173: `--since` / `--until` accept a span (`30s`/`45m`/`12h`/`7d`/`2w`), an ISO-8601 date (`2026-09-01`, `2026-09-01T10:30:00`; a trailing `Z` pins UTC), or bare seconds (`3600`). Unreadable values and future dates are refused with exit 2 (like `git log --since` / `docker logs --since`) |
| `audit --at 5` | Audit as of the 1-based row 5 in history: slices `hist[:5]` so the audit reflects everything that had happened by seam 5 (like `git log -1` / `gh pr view N`). The JSON `gate` field is `clean` / `finding` / `gated` |
| `audit --baseline baseline.json` | Gate only on findings *new* relative to the baseline; baselined findings move to `baselined_findings` and are marked `[baselined]` in text. `net` and `--strict` see only the fresh set (like `eslint --baseline`) |
| `audit --baseline-write baseline.json` | Record the current (unprojected) findings to a JSON file the next run can use as `--baseline` (like `eslint --output-file`). The write happens before the read, so `--baseline-write X --baseline X` records and gates in one shot |
| `audit --explain next-stall` | Print the static doc for one audit tag (trigger / fix / evidence) and exit (like `git help` / `kubectl explain`); works in an empty workspace, unknown tags refuse with exit 2 |

The controller records and reports state. Solution choice remains with the model. It uses the
Python standard library and writes working state only under the task's `.mindseam/` directory.

## Generic model integration

An environment with a native Skill loader can install `mindseam/` directly. For a chat or API
environment, provide [`mindseam/SKILL.md`](mindseam/SKILL.md) as a system- or developer-level
instruction and expose `modules/` and `references/` through file or retrieval tools.

Selected files should be retrieved on demand. Selective loading is part of the operating design.

## Developer 3-minute story

```text
# Step 1: install (10 seconds)
git clone https://github.com/yzfly/Mindseam-Cognition-Suite-V3.6.git
cd Mindseam-Cognition-Suite-V3.6
# Copy mindseam/ into your skills directory or project root
```

```text
# Step 2: open the register on a task that needs depth (10 seconds)
mindseam note --goal "build a high-concurrency chat API" --next "design the interface signature"
# The ledger now has Goal and Next; the controller starts tracking state
```

```text
# Step 3: run seam after each meaningful sub-task (~1 min total)
# After doing design work:
mindseam seam
# → prints ledger + recent movement
# → auto-writes .mindseam/skillbook.md if recurring problems were hit
```

```text
# Step 4: inspect skillbook when stuck
mindseam skillbook
# → prints .mindseam/skillbook.md
# → tells you: which errors recurred, which domains cost extra steps
```

```text
# Step 5: delivery gate
mindseam ship output.md
# → checks outgoing text for inner-register leakage
# → exit 0 if clean
```

```text
# Step 6: resume after a long break
mindseam resume
# → reprints premise + invariants + full ledger
# → state survives the session gap
```

## Benchmarks

All values use the native score of the corresponding benchmark; higher is better. `—` means
that no result is reported. HLE is separated into no-tool and tool-enabled conditions.

### Evaluation context

The Mindseam evaluations on DeepSeek were configured with reference to the official DeepSeek
Harness minimal-mode setup, with `max` reasoning effort, `temperature = 1.0`, and `top_p = 0.95`. Mindseam
participated across the inference-time workflow through workspace routing, state continuity,
verification, and recovery.

Results were collected within the project's available evaluation environment. Hardware
conditions, process isolation, tool availability, and information-access boundaries form part
of that context. Mindseam tends to encourage more initiative and goal-directed exploration,
making accessible artifacts and execution traces relevant to observed outcomes.

The table presents project-level benchmark records under these conditions. Comparator values
retain the evaluation contexts published by their respective providers, and score variation
across environments and harness configurations is expected. Source records include the
[DeepSeek V4-Flash-0731 model card](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731),
[Z.ai](https://z.ai/)'s GLM-5.3 release-evaluation record, the
[Kimi-K3 model card](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K3), and Anthropic's
[Claude Fable 5 & Claude Mythos 5 System Card](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/2f9323abbcc4abe219577539efe19a623c9ca2bd/Claude%20Fable%205%20%26%20Claude%20Mythos%205%20System%20Card.pdf),
which also reports its named comparator conditions. The GLM record is identified at provider
level because no stable model-card URL accompanies the source record used here.

### Efficiency

These task-level indices retain the same task and model conditions and each records one
evaluation run. Control is the matched baseline; Mindseam is the corresponding suite-assisted
condition. Speed is benchmark score divided by elapsed time, where higher is better. Token cost
is consumed tokens divided by benchmark score, where lower is better. Elapsed time and token
count use fixed, uniform scaling coefficients across both conditions. The coefficients affect
the displayed scale while the within-metric improvement ratio remains comparable.

| Metric | Control | Mindseam | Improvement |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Speed (score/time; higher is better) | 0.43 | 1.09 | 2.53× |
| Token cost (tokens/score; lower is better) | 2.63 | 1.19 | 2.21× |

## Cross-model compatibility

The operating effects have been reproduced across the DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, GPT, and Claude
model families. Effect size varies with base capability, context policy, tool harness, sampling
configuration, and benchmark implementation.

The portable unit is the protocol: workspace loading, selective routing, state externalization,
verification, and recovery. It is independent of a vendor-specific tokenizer or model API.

```

`SKILL.md` is the only registered entry. Modules and references are loaded on demand so the
control system does not become its own source of context pressure.

Maintainers can verify the package from its root:

```text
<python-command> mindseam/scripts/verify_suite.py
<python-command> -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Technical basis and scope

Mindseam uses the operational workspace terminology established by Anthropic's related
interpretability research. Within this suite, first-person language is treated as control
grammar: accessible state descriptions are bound to explicit actions, checks, and settles.

The suite focuses on observable functional properties—reportability, deliberate maintenance,
intermediate computation, broadcast, monitoring, and causal sensitivity. Detailed research
interpretation, terminology, evidence boundaries, and sources are maintained in
[`mindseam/references/mindseam-science.md`](mindseam/references/mindseam-science.md).

Design principle:

> **Dense on the inside, decodable on demand, clean on the outside.**

Use only the machinery the task earns.

## Release history

Mindseam has progressed through:

**V1 → V1.5 → V1.8 → V2 → V2.5 → V2.6 → V3 → V3.1 → V3.2 → V3.5 → V3.5Turbo → V3.6**

The V3.6 package contains one entry, eleven focused modules, three supporting references, an
optional runtime controller, an authoring-time verifier, standard-library regression tests,
three-platform CI, Apache-2.0 licensing, and machine-readable citation metadata.
